## Code Design

Basically I follow the instruction given by the assignment.

What I want to achieve is reuse as many code as possible so as to make the whole structure clear and clean.

Also, I create a new class named Testcase to do all the testing jobs. As it is, my main function of the simulator class will be short and easy to understand.

I test the program with five cases, they are

1. Within the purchased parking time
2. The same as the purchased parking time
3. Beyond the purchased parking time(1min)
4. Ticketing within 1 hour
5. Ticketing beyond 1 hour

All the outputs are in the test_output.txt file.
