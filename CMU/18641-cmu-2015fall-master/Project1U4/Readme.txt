# Project1 Unit4

## Platform

+ Operating System: OS X El Capitan 10.11
+ Eclipse Version: Java EE IDE Mars Release(4.5.0)
+ Java Version: JavaSE-1.7

## How to Run the project

1. Import these two projects into Eclipse
2. Run the server first(server.Server.java)
3. Then run the client (client.SocketClient.java)

Almost all the output can be seen from the terminal of the Client, including:

1. Function Selection: 1 for upload, 2 for configure
2. For upload, just choose the index from the file list
3. For configuration
    3.1 First choose a model
    3.2 Then the program will iterate from the first optionset to the last
    3.3 Just choose by inputing the index
4. After configuration there will be a complete figure to show your choices.

Shut down the server will cause client encounting errors, so just close the client first.

The test output can be seen in separate project folders. More detail descriptions are in the client/server folder. This readme just gives you a glance of the project.
