# Word Density Analysis

Author: Da Wang
Email: dawang@andrew.cmu.edu

## Design

The Design is quite simple. With two helper classes (HtmlPage and Ngrammer),
the main function will call the class Analyser to finish the word density
analysis job and print out the result.

Different classes don't rely on each other so that it will be easy to
integrate them into different module. Also, simple exception message will be
shown if something goes wrong

## Approach

The main approach for word density analysis in my implementation contains two
major part: Ngram and different weights for different formats.

For the Ngram part, after splitting sentences to words, I filtered out
stopwords so as to only keep the meaningful words meanwhile accelerate
computing process. Then I generated N-gram pattern for these words and count
their appearance.

For measuring how relevant the ngram phrases are, I handle different part of
the web page one by one. If a word appears in title, it will contribute more to
its relevant score than in body. The weights can be set by man or optimized
with machine learning techniques. Title/Metadata/Header/Body/Href are treated
differently to get a more understanding result.

## Data Structure

I use HashSet to store the stopwords so that it will only take O(1) time to
check if the word is a stopword.

I use HashMap to store the temporary result for the ngram phrases and their
relevant score.

The reason for using TreeMap is that based on red-black tree, this data
structure sorted its elements so that when I need to fetch the top N result,
it won't be a difficult task. Though it may take more time than just using
the hashmap. But with an average O(log n) time complexity and sorted result,
it is a tradeoff that makes sense.

Using ArrayDeque has the same reason - fast visiting even with lots of elements.
