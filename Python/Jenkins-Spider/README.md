# Jenkins-Spider

This is a tool for CMU ECE 18-645 Course: **How to write fast code**. We need to submit our homework to the Jenkins Platform and get to know how long it takes to finish runing our code. But it is difficult for us to know how well our code is. 

If you really want to know that, this is what you want! you can know your standing as well as the performance. Just like the following table:

    01: ('team020_matmul', 'SUCCESS', '37.3589')
    02: ('team058_matmul', 'SUCCESS', '41.7769')
    03: ('team006_matmul', 'SUCCESS', '43.812')
    04: ('team032_matmul', 'SUCCESS', '44.3838')
    05: ('team016_matmul', 'SUCCESS', '48.376')
    06: ('team015_matmul', 'SUCCESS', '48.395')
    07: ('team012_matmul', 'SUCCESS', '51.3162')
    08: ('team050_matmul', 'SUCCESS', '51.957')
    09: ('team037_matmul', 'SUCCESS', '53.0759')
    10: ('team055_matmul', 'SUCCESS', '54.3049')
    11: ('team005_matmul', 'SUCCESS', '55.7141')
    12: ('team061_matmul', 'SUCCESS', '57.6008')
    13: ('team013_matmul', 'SUCCESS', '59.1211')
    14: ('team010_matmul', 'SUCCESS', '64.3389')
    15: ('team030_matmul', 'SUCCESS', '64.387')
    
## How to use

It's very easy to use because as you see there are only two .py files. I use Python 2.7 for this project so if you insist in using Python 3, you have to debug it yourself.

1. Fork/Download the code
2. Uncompress it
3. Make sure you have python on your computer
4. Run `python spider.py` in the terminal
5. Wait until everything is done

## Notice

If you meet the following problem, don't worry, you can still get things done:

1. It may take longer time for the first running, just be patience.
2. If things always go wrong, delete the `data` folder and restart the spider.
3. For the second time, the program will run in `OFFLINE` mode, if you want to go `ONLINE`, delete the `data` folder
